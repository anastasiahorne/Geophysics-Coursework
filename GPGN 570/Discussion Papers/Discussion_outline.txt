5 minute rundown on key points and the paper
Then ask if anyone came across any questions they want answered before we start the discussion
then start asking questions
	maybe start by asking their general thoughts about the paper, did they notice anything done particularly well or particularly bad?
	if nobody answers then maybe start talking about the lack of detail in figure 2, or mention the 0.9 mm mistake...?
